# NimbleNASM

## Introduction

I created this repository as a tracker for my Cryptography progress. The plan is to work on increasingly complex ciphers using nothing but `x86`, `NASM` assembly.   

You can find a walkthrough on each of the ciphers within their directory, where I analyse the methodology behind each implementation a bit more thoroughly. 

## Motivation

Not sure what motivated me to do this, but I've always wanted to hone my cryptography skills, as well as improve my understanding of the assembly language; I guess this is a way to do both. I've also wanted to explore writing proper documentation and blogpost-style papers, so that is an added bonus.
